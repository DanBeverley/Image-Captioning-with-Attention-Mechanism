# Image Captioning with Attention Mechanism

This project implements an advanced image captioning model using an attention mechanism. The model is designed to generate contextually relevant captions for images by learning from a Flickr8k dataset. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting image features and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms for generating descriptive text.

## Introduction

Image captioning is a challenging task in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). The goal is to generate a textual description for a given image. This project explores a deep learning approach where an attention mechanism is employed to improve the relevance and quality of the generated captions. The model is trained and tested on the Flickr8k dataset, a standard dataset for image captioning tasks.

## Dataset

The Flickr8k dataset consists of 8,000 images, each paired with five different captions describing the content of the image. The dataset is divided into three parts:

- **Training Set**: 6,000 images
- **Validation Set**: 1,000 images
- **Test Set**: 1,000 images

Each image is associated with multiple captions, providing diverse descriptions for the model to learn from.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of three primary components:

1. **Encoder (CNN)**:
   - A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (such as ResNet-50) is used as the encoder.
   - The CNN is responsible for extracting high-level features from the input images.
   - The output from the CNN is a feature map that represents the image's content.

2. **Attention Mechanism**:
   - The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the image when generating each word in the caption.
   - It dynamically weights the image features based on the current state of the RNN decoder.

3. **Decoder (RNN)**:
   - The decoder is typically an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network.
   - It takes the weighted image features and generates the caption word by word.
   - The decoder is trained to predict the next word in the caption sequence given the previous words and the image features.

## Training Procedure

### Preprocessing

1. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Images are resized and normalized before being fed into the CNN.
   - Data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping may be used to improve generalization.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Captions are tokenized, converted to lowercase, and stripped of punctuation.
   - A vocabulary is built, and captions are encoded into sequences of word indices.
   - Sequences are padded to ensure uniform input lengths.

### Model Training

1. **Loss Function**:
   - The loss function used is Cross-Entropy Loss, which measures the difference between the predicted word distributions and the actual word indices.

2. **Optimizer**:
   - The Adam optimizer is used with an initial learning rate, which may be decayed over time.

3. **Training Loop**:
   - The model is trained for a fixed number of epochs, with the loss and evaluation metrics monitored on the validation set.
   - Early stopping and checkpointing may be implemented to save the best model based on validation performance.

### Hyperparameters

- **Batch Size**: Typically set to 64 or 128 depending on the available GPU memory.
- **Learning Rate**: An initial value of 0.001 with decay.
- **Embedding Dimension**: 256 or 512 depending on the model size.
- **Hidden Dimension**: 512 or 1024 for the LSTM units.


## Results

After training, the model generates captions for the test images. Below are sample results:

  - **Generated Caption**: "A man on a beach playing with a dog."
  - **Reference Captions**:
    1. "A man is standing on the beach with a dog."
    2. "A person on the shore with a dog running beside him."
    3. ...
